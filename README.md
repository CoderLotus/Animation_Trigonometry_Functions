# Animation_Trigonometry_Functions
An advanced trigonometric function visualization using Python and Matplotlib. This project features:

- Animated plotting of 4 different trigonometric functions with damping, growth, and phase shifts
- Real-time calculation and visualization of function "energy" (integral of squares)
- Modern styling with custom colors and visual elements
- Interactive elements like phase arrows and fill-between areas
- Dynamic energy comparison bars

Built with:
- Python 3
- NumPy for mathematical operations
- Matplotlib for visualization and animation
